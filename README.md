# RISCV
The content of RISCV and RISCV_system is almost the same (there is a documentation folder in RISCV_system but not needed if you run the code with doxygen, the documentation will also be generated). \n
The difference between RISCV and RISCV_system is that RISCV_system is organised with folders whereas RISCV is not.\n
For now, the instructions tested are FENCE and ADDI. They are working properly. To complete the project, all the other instructions from the instruction set must be implemented and written especially in the xml file.\n
About the xml and the hex files, they have to be put in the folder where Qmake build the project.
